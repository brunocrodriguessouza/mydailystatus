 * A write batch, used to perform multiple writes as a single atomic unit.

 * A `GeoWriteBatch` object can be acquired by calling `GeoFirestore.batch()`. It provides methods for adding writes to the write batch.
 * None of the writes will be committed (or visible locally) until `GeoWriteBatch.commit()` is called.

 * Unlike transactions, write batches are persisted offline and therefore are preferable when you don't need to condition your writes on
